Below are the instructions for this section of the test.</p><h3>Instructions:</h3><ol><li><strong>Scroll Test:</strong> Please scroll down the page to any desired position using your preferred scrolling method (scroll wheel, touchpad, or touch screen). Take your time to find a comfortable scroll position.</li><li><strong>Navigation Test:</strong> Now, click on the \"Logo\" link in the nav bar. This link will take you to the home page. Afterward, use the browser's back button or history navigation to return to this section.</li><li><strong>Scroll Restoration Assessment:</strong> Upon returning to this section, observe if the scroll position has been accurately restored to the position where you left off. The scroll restoration should place you at the same position, ensuring a seamless transition without losing your context.</li><li><strong>Repeat Test (Optional):</strong> If you wish to perform the scroll restoration test multiple times, feel free to do so. Scroll to different positions each time before navigating away and coming back. The restoration should consistently bring you back to the exact position you were in.</li><li><strong>Verification:</strong> As you perform the scroll restoration test, you can also verify the restoration by visually matching a distinct point on the page (e.g., a specific text) as a reference.</li><li><strong>Different Devices and Browsers:</strong> For a comprehensive evaluation, try this test on various devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones) using different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.). Verify that the scroll restoration works consistently across different environments.</li><li><strong>Feedback:</strong> We highly value your feedback and observations on the basic scroll restoration feature. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please let us know. Your input will assist us in fine-tuning this critical aspect of the browsing experience.</li></ol><p>Thank you for participating in our basic scroll restoration test. Your contribution is invaluable in ensuring a smoother and more enjoyable browsing experience for all our users. Happy testing!</p>"
